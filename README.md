Interactive flag showing the adoption of marriage equality by state 

##Description

This interactive HTML5 flag shows the progress of marriage equality over time, state-by-state. There are currently no plans to extend this project outside the scope of the United States. For more detailed information, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States

There may or may not be an easter egg.
